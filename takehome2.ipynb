The only way I can think of them being dependent is if some patient's know each other intimiately, friends or family, and the heart attacks of their loved ones potentially triggers or quickens the onset of some people's heart attacks. This would likely be a small effect that could potentially be accounted for, but the aforementioned effect is probably so negligable that adding it into the model would unnecessarily complicate it.

For example, suppose that $1$ random heart attack took place. Since we can say that $1$ heart attack certainly occurred on one distinct day, we know that $H_{1} = 1$. That is, think about splitting up the year into $365$ equivalent time slots, which are days. The probability of $1$ heart attack occuring in one of these time slots that does not also have a heart attack in it is $365/365$ because it is equally likely it is within any of these slots (hence dividing by $365$) and all of the slots are available (hence the numerator of $365$).

For one thing, this scenario reduces the number of pilots who die, which should be the main priority of the bombers; however, each of these bombers becomes less effective somehow. If we look at the pdf for $E$ we can see that this recuding of $P_{detect}$ has somewhat of a combo-effect. That is, it reduces the likelyhood of people being spotted, so it results in less people being targeted, and, thus, less people dying. The likelyhood of success also seems to be less decreased by a proportional decrease in $p$ than it is by the increase in $P_{detect}$ because $p$ only shows up in the term multiplied by $E$, and that term is inversely proportational to the $1 -p$ that takes on a large exponient--an exponient that is made larger by the decrease in $P_{detect}$.

If even one of the 20-gallon aquariums remains in stock, no new units are ordered.

Our assumptions about the supply of aquariums have already been made by the store's current inventory policy, which we may or may not alter to improve profits.
