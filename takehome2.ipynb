The only way I can think of them being dependent is if some patient's know each other intimiately, friends or family, and the heart attacks of their loved ones potentially triggers or quickens the onset of some people's heart attacks. This would likely be a small effect that could potentially be accounted for, but the aforementioned effect is probably so negligable that adding it into the model would unnecessarily complicate it.

For example, suppose that $1$ random heart attack took place. Since we can say that $1$ heart attack certainly occurred on one distinct day, we know that $H_{1} = 1$. That is, think about splitting up the year into $365$ equivalent time slots, which are days. The probability of $1$ heart attack occuring in one of these time slots that does not also have a heart attack in it is $365/365$ because it is equally likely it is within any of these slots (hence dividing by $365$) and all of the slots are available (hence the numerator of $365$).
